````
1. User Interface (UI):
This is where customers select goods or services and choose to pay with cryptocurrency.
The interface can be in the form of a web or mobile application.

2. Payment Gateway:
This system processes users' payment requests.
It generates a cryptocurrency address and the exact amount due, providing this information to the user, often including a QR code for easy payment.

3. Transaction Monitoring:
Monitors transactions on the blockchain network and updates the status as the transaction is confirmed.
Ensures that the transaction is successfully recorded on the blockchain.

4. Payment Confirmation and Processing:
Once the transaction is successfully included in the blockchain, it confirms the transaction and triggers the provision of goods or services.

5. Database and Backend:
Stores transaction records, user information, product details, etc.
Manages the entire system with enhanced security backend logic.

6. Blockchain Interface:
Communicates directly with the cryptocurrency network (e.g., Bitcoin, Ethereum) to send and verify transactions.
Can also interact with smart contracts if applicable.
